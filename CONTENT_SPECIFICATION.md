## FAQ Section

### Section Header

```
Frequently Asked Questions
```

### Six FAQs

#### 1. Does Action.IT train its AI models on my meeting data?

**Answer:**

```
No. Unlike most AI meeting notetakers, Action.IT never trains on your data. We use enterprise-grade encryption, SOC 2–compliant infrastructure, and strict access controls to ensure your information stays protected. This means your team benefits from powerful AI assistance without your conversations ever being used to train third-party models.
```

#### 2. Does Action.IT integrate with project management tools like Monday, Asana, or Linear?

**Answer:**

```
Yes. Action.IT connects with popular project management platforms such as Asana, Monday, Jira, Linear, and ClickUp. After each meeting, action items captured in Action.IT can be automatically synced to your task lists or assigned to teammates – so follow-ups don't fall through the cracks.
```

#### 3. Can Action.IT sync meeting notes and insights to CRMs like Salesforce and HubSpot?

**Answer:**

```
Yes. Action.IT integrates natively with Salesforce and HubSpot. It identifies relevant details from your meeting – such as deal updates, contact notes, or next steps – and suggests CRM fields to update automatically, keeping your pipeline data accurate and current.
```

#### 4. Is Action.IT secure for Enterprise use?

**Answer:**

```
Yes! Action.IT was built from the ground up with security, privacy and control first. We follow security best practices including end-to-end encryption and continuous monitoring. Action.IT is SOC2, HIPAA, and GDPR compliant.
```

#### 5. How can I get started?

**Answer:**

```
You can get started with Action.IT for yourself, your team, or your whole organization for free! You'll have 14 days of free access to the Action.IT Pro plan which includes AI recording credits for you to test out. After 14 days, you'll be downgraded to the free plan (free forever).
```

#### 6. Who can access my recordings and AI meeting notes in Action.IT?

**Answer:**

```
By default, your Action.IT meeting notes and recordings are only accessible to internal meeting attendees. That means sensitive meetings like one-on-ones and leadership meetings are kept private. You can choose to make meeting recordings accessible outside of attendees by sharing them to custom recording channels. These can be accessible to the entire workspace or a subset of users — totally up to you!
